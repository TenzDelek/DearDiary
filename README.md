## Getting Started

We are happy to have you contribute to our project! Follow these steps to set up your local environment and start making contributions.

## Project Setup

### Prerequisites

To get started, you will need:

- **Node.js** (v16 or later) installed.
- **Git** for cloning and version control.
- **Clerk Account** for authentication (you will need API keys).

### Cloning the Repository

First, fork this repository by clicking the "Fork" button at the top. Then, clone your forked copy to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/DearDiary.git
```

### To navigate into the project directory:

```bash
cd DearDiary
```

### Installing Dependencies

To install all required dependencies, run:

```bash
npm install

```

This command will install Next.js, Clerk, and other necessary libraries.

Setting Up Clerk

- Sign Up for Clerk: If you haven‚Äôt already, sign up at [Clerk.dev](https://clerk.dev/) and create an application.

- Get API Keys: Once your application is set up, get your Frontend API Key and Secret Key.

- Add Environment Variables: Create a .env.local file in the root directory:

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_FRONTEND_API=<YOUR_FRONTEND_API_KEY>
CLERK_API_KEY=<YOUR_SECRET_KEY>
```

Verify Configuration: Double-check that the keys are correctly set up by running:

```bash
npm run dev
```

You should be able to access the application at http://localhost:3000 and see Clerk authentication enabled.

### Running the Project

To start the development server, use:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Your local server will be running at http://localhost:3000.

Thank you for pointing that out! Here‚Äôs the updated **Docker setup instructions** section for your `README.md`, including the relevant information about the `DATABASE_URL`.

---

## Docker Setup Instructions

To set up the application using Docker, follow these steps:

### 1. **Configure the Database URL**

Ensure that your `.env` file contains the below `DATABASE_URL`. It should be the this:

```plaintext
DATABASE_URL=postgres://user:password@db:5432/mydatabase
```

### 2. **Build and Start Docker Containers**

To build the Docker images and start the containers, run the following command:

```bash
npm run docker:setup
```

This command will:

- Build the Docker containers using `docker-compose build`.
- Start the containers using `docker-compose up -d`.
- Run the Prisma migrations to ensure your database is up to date.
- Open **Web App** in your browser at `http://localhost:3000`.
- Open **Prisma Studio** for database management in your browser at `http://localhost:5555`.

### 3. **Managing Docker Containers**

You can manage the Docker containers with the following commands:

- **Start the containers** (if they are stopped):

  ```bash
  npm run docker:start
  ```

- **Stop the containers** (without removing them):

  ```bash
  npm run docker:stop
  ```

- **Restart the containers**:

  ```bash
  npm run docker:restart
  ```

- **Take down the containers** (stop and remove):

  ```bash
  npm run docker:down
  ```

- **Rebuild the containers without using cache**:
  ```bash
  npm run docker:build --no-cache
  ```

---

## Prisma Commands

Prisma is used for interacting with your PostgreSQL database. Here are the available Prisma commands:

### 1. **Run Migrations**

To apply your Prisma schema and migrate your database, use:

```bash
npm run prisma:migrate
```

This command will run the migrations within the Docker container and update the database schema.

### 2. **Open Prisma Studio**

Prisma Studio provides a GUI to explore and edit your database. To open Prisma Studio, run:

```bash
npm run prisma:studio
```

After running the command, open your browser and go to `http://localhost:5555` to access Prisma Studio.

### 3. **Push Prisma Schema to Database**

If you've updated your Prisma schema and want to push changes to your database without creating migration files, run:

```bash
npm run prisma:push
```

### 4. **Pull Database Schema into Prisma**

If your database schema has changed and you want to update your Prisma schema, you can pull the changes with:

```bash
npm run prisma:pull
```

### 5. **Generate Prisma Client**

To regenerate the Prisma client after making schema changes, use:

```bash
npm run prisma:generate
```

This command is automatically run on production during the `postinstall` phase if the environment is not set to `development`.
